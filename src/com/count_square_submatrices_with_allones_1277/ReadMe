Create a dp table(where dp stands for dynamic programming)
Initialize each of row and column of the matrix
check each position and take the minimal of previous square dp, above square dp and on the previous diagonal
Add 1 to it
Like: dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j - 1])
add it also
