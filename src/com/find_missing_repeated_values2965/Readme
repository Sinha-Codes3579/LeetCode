1. Calculate total number of elements expected.
2. Create a frequency counter for numbers 1 to n^2.
3. Iterate through the grid and count the occurences of each number.
4. Identify the number that appears twice(frequency = 2) as 'a'.
5. Identify the number that is missing (frequency = 0) as 'b'.
7.Return [a, b]
Time complexity = O[n^2]
Space complexity = O[n^2]
